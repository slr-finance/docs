# Harvest Lockup

Harvest lockup is a unique and creative farming rewards lockup mechanism. This mechanism can help us limit the frequency of harvest to prevent farming arbitrage bots from constant harvest and dump.

For example, the staking lockup of the [neptune](https://app.slr.finance/pool/neptune) pool is between 4 and 7 days. Staker can make a choice of the lockup time within 4 and 7 days. as there is an auto daily compound in the pool, it is profitable to choose maximum lockup time. It means that stakers who stake in the neptune pool can only harvest (claim their rewards and deposit withdrawal from pool) after selected lockup time.

You can check the harvest lockup on each pool page.
