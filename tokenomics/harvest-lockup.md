# Harvest Lockup

Harvest lockup is a unique and creative farming rewards lockup mechanism. This mechanism can help us limit the frequency of harvest to prevent farming arbitrage bots from constantly harvesting and dump.

For example, the staking lockup of the [neptune](https://app.slr.finance/pool/neptune) pool is between 4 and 7 days. Staker can make choose the lockup time between 4 and 7 days. Т.к. в пуле автоматическое ежедневное реинвестирование, то выгоднее выбирать максимальный период блокировки. It means that stakers who stake in the neptune pool can only harvest (claim their rewards and withdrawal deposit from pool) after chosen lockup time.

You can check the harvest lockup on each pool page.
