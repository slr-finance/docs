# MilkyWay

As it was mentioned previously, there is a 10% transfer tax on each transaction, the 4.5% transfer tax will be added to the SLR-BNB liquidity pool through the contract automatically. Every time the total of this transfer tax exceeds 1000 SLR the contract will automatically sell 500 SLR for BNB and add liquidity to Pancake Swap SLR-BNB pool.

Remaining 4.5% will be invested in farms such as Nomiswap, Pancake Swap and Biswap, and the contract will claim rewards and then buy back SLR and add to the liquidity pool.

This liquidity will be burned, raising the price floor every time as a transaction is made. It is very beneficial for long term because it keeps price level of SLR and raises it over time.

The buyback fund comes from the profit of other farming, so the more time the project runs, the longer bigger the fund, Hence, the buyback is unlimited.

In the world of DeFi, buybacks are a prevalent mechanism to support price. However, most projects carry out “Buy Back and Burn”, which does nothing to improve the position of the LP (Liquidity Pool). In sharp contrast, MilkyWay improves the buyback process to increase liquidity every time, by not only raising the price but making it more stable ove time.
