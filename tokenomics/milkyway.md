  MilkyWay uses farming profits to regularly buy $SLR and $BNB, then "burn" them
  to liquidity.

# MilkyWay

As mentioned previously, there is a 10% transfer tax on each transaction, the 4.5% transfer tax will be added to the SLR-BNB liquidity pool through the contract automatically. Every time the total of this transfer tax exceed 1000 SLR the contract will automatically sell 500 SLR for BNB and adding liquidity to Pancakeswap SLR-BNB pool.

Remaining 4.5% will be invested in farms such as Nomiswap, Pancake Swap and Biswap, and compound and then buy back SLR and add to the liquidity pool.

This liquidity will be burned, raising the price floor every time a transaction be made. It is very beneficial for long term because it keep price level of SLR and raises it over time.

The buyback's fund comes from profit of others farming, so the more time the project run, the bigger the fund —-> buyback is unlimited.

In the world of DeFi, buy backs are a prevalent mechanism to support price. However, most projects will “Buy Back and Burn”, which does nothing to improve the position of the LP (Liquidity Pool). In sharp contrast, MilkyWay has improved the buy back process to increase liquidity at the same time, which makes price both increase and more stable over time.
